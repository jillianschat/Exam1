## Midterm.
  
#### 1.  Map the delay by destination.
  
  Compute the average delay by destination, then join on the airports data frame so you can show the spatial distribution of delays. Hereâ€™s an easy way to draw a map of the United States.  You are welcome to use this code or some other code. 

```{r} 
library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)

View(flights)

flights %>%
  group_by(dest) %>%
  summarise(av_delay = mean(dep_delay))

View(airports)

airports %>%
  left_join(flights, c("faa" = "dest")) %>%
  group_by(faa) %>%
  ggplot(aes(lon, lat)) +
  borders("state") +
  geom_point() +
  coord_quickmap()

```

You might want to use the size or colour of the points to display the average delay for each airport.

```{r}

flights
planes
airlines
airports
weather

# put your answer here.
```


#### 2.   Do planes trade ownership?

You might expect that thereâ€™s an implicit relationship between plane and airline, because each plane is flown by a single airline. Confirm or reject this conjecture using data.

```{r}
flights %>%
  left_join(planes, by = "tailnum")
# 336,776 rows

flights %>%
  right_join(planes, by = "tailnum")
# 284,170 rows

# so yes, carriers to trade planes

```


#### 3.  Plane's average speed.

Notice that ```flights$air_time``` is in minutes.  Make a new column that is the air time in hours. 

```{r}
flights %>%
  mutate(air_time_hours = air_time/60)
View(flights)
```


#### 4. Average speed

For each flight, compute the average speed of that flight (in miles per hour).  Then, for each plane, compute the average of those average speeds. Display it in a histogram. You can use a base R histogram ```hist``` or ggplot's ```geom_histogram```. 

```{r}
flights %>%
  mutate(speed = distance/air_time*60) %>%
  group_by(tailnum) %>%
  summarise(plane_speed = mean(speed))

flights %>%
  mutate(speed = air_time/distance*60) %>%
  group_by(tailnum) %>%
  summarise(plane_speed = mean(speed)) %>%
  geom_histogram(y = plane_speed, x = flights$tailnum, na.rm = TRUE)
```




#### 5. What correlates with average speed?

To examine if there is anything in the plane data that correlates with average speed, use ```geom_boxplot``` with average speed of the plane (in previous question) on the y-axis and ```planes$engine``` on the x-axis.  Do the same for ```planes$engines``` and ```planes$type```.  

```{r}
flights %>%
  semi_join(planes, c("tailnum" = "tailnum")) %>%
  mutate(plane_speed = distance/air_time) %>%
  geom_boxplot(y = plane_speed, x = engine)

geom_boxplot(y = plane_speed, x = engines)
geom_boxplot(y = type, x = type)
```
